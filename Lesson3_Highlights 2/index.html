            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is essentially, a version control system. However, it is a bit different than a normal version control system. The main difference is the way that Git analyzes its data. Git takes its data and sees the data as "snapshots" of sort. The only thing git needs to operate with are just local files and some resources, nothing else! Git is a version control system with integrity. It goes in and checks all the data before it is stored and is then referred by checksum. The biggest thing about Git though is where the files reside in. They reside in comitted, modified and staged.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is an essential part of the git process! Version control is basically the system that records changes to a file or a set of files over time. That way the user can go back through these files as they change for reference. Version Control Systems are extremely beneficial to graphic and web designers to keep every version of the images they work on! There are three types of version controls. They are called "Local Version Control System", "Centralized Version Control System", and "Distributed Version Control System". The difference between the systems is the location of the servers in relation to computers that it is going to. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Getting a Git repository is quite possibly the most important part of Git! There are two ways to get a project going. The first way is to build off of an already existing project and import it into Git. The second method is to take an already existing Git repository from a different server. Once a Git repository has been added there are several things that can be done with the said repository! It can be initialized and one can begin and stop tracking the files in the system. Not only that but one can also learn how to ignore files, undo mistakes and push and pull from remote repositories.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Repository Changes</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Each repository has two different states that can be in: either tracked or untracked. These tracked files were the most recent snapshots and can be easily changed and staged. The untracked files are basically everything else that are not ones latest snapshots! In order to check these files the command: "git status" is used. In order to track the newer the command: "git add" is used. A timeline of the order of changing these repositories is as follows: untracked to unmodified to modified and finally to staged. Once it is staged the cycle goes back to untracked and begins once more! </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github is the largest repository holding websites known! Git is used by programmers, designers and everyone in between. To setup a Github account one uses an email address and password for login. The most important part of getting setup is the SSH key! This SSH key allows your project to be transferred into Git and allows Git access to your project that is on a different server (such as Cloud 9). For extra protection, there is a two-factor authentication option in the setting under ones Github account. Once the SSH key is in, anyone can freely setup their repositories and begin working. </p>
