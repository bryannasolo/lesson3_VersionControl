## Project Description:
(We created a GitHub account to learn about Version Control Systems. In Github we created a repository to put our Cloud9 account for Lesson 3 in it!)

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. One lesson was about the basics of git. I learned that it is a version control system that holds files as if they were snapshots.
2. Another lesson learned was about version control systems. There are three different systems that are different according to how the servers were linked to computers.
3. The last lesson learned was how to set up a Github account. It is the largest Git repository system. It is easy to create an account and an SSH key is used to allow permission for Github to look into your projects.
